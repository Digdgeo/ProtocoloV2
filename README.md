# Protocolo V2

Hi There!

This is the version 2 (actually it's the 5th) but the second official one) to normalize Landsat images based on Pseudo Invariant Areas (PIAs).

There will be a lot to say but now we are just starting and this is a previate repo yet ;P

By now all that we can say is that Magic happens in Landsat and Products classes, but all the job is controled and done by download.py.
