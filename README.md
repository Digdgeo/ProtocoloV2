# ü§ñ Protocolo V2

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.2.3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Digdgeo/ProtocoloV2) [![Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/protocolov2/badge/?version=latest)](https://protocolov2.readthedocs.io/)


Hi There! üëã

Welcome to Protocolo V2 ü§ñ ‚Äî the latest and most advanced iteration of our Landsat image normalization and processing workflow. Built around the concept of Pseudo Invariant Areas (PIAs), this project fully automates the generation of high-quality environmental products such as NDVI maps, inundation masks, turbidity estimates, and coastal lines enhanced with sea level data from tide gauges.
Whether you are managing wetlands, monitoring coastal dynamics, or simply exploring large-scale Earth observation data, Protocolo V2 provides a robust, modular, and scalable solution ready for operational use.

Here you have a glimpse of the workflow, but full documentation is available in Read the Docs [Protocolo V2 Docs](https://protocolov2.readthedocs.io/).

## What's Inside

This repo is centered around three main classes:

- **`Landsat`**: Handles the normalization and processing of Landsat images.
- **`Products`**: Generates the derived products such as NDVI, water turbidity, and flood masks.
- **`Coast`**: Extracts the coastline (wet/dry line) from flood masks within the Espacio Natural de Do√±ana and assigns each line the corresponding sea level height from the Bonanza tide gauge.

All the magic is orchestrated and controlled by `download.py`, which automates the entire workflow.

## Features

- Normalize Landsat images using **PIAs** (Pseudo Invariant Areas).
- Generate various environmental products such as NDVI, flood masks, and turbidity maps.
- Extract and store coastline lines associated with tide levels.
- Process multiple scenes automatically and store results in a MongoDB database.
- Hydroperiod calculation for wetland management.

## Usage

1. **Normalization Process**: The main script handles Landsat normalization using PIAs.
2. **Product Generation**: Use the `Products` class to generate NDVI, turbidity, and other key products.
3. **Coastline Extraction**: Use the `Coast` class to extract the wet/dry boundary and assign tide gauge levels.
4. **Data Handling**: All job control and automation are managed by `download.py`.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- Git (only required if cloning the repository)  
- MongoDB (if used in your configuration)  

1. Install Directly from GitHub (Recommended for Users)

Install the package and its dependencies directly from the GitHub repository using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Digdgeo/ProtocoloV2.git
```
This command will install the package and all its dependencies in one go. This is the easiest way to get started with Protocolo V2.

2. Clone and Install (Recommended for Developers)

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Digdgeo/ProtocoloV2.git
cd ProtocoloV2
```

Install in editable mode (for development):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag links the package to your Python environment, allowing live code changes without reinstallation.

3. Production Installation (Non-Editable)

If you only need to use the package (no modifications), install it from the local cloned repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Digdgeo/ProtocoloV2.git
cd ProtocoloV2
pip install .
```


#### Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

## To Do List üìù

- [x] Include script for executing hydroperiod (data preparation) (done! ‚úÖ)
- [x] Make the Docs üìñ
- [ ] Create a video tutorial (üé•)
- [x] Check old and new water masks (six checked) (done! ‚úÖ)
- [x] Add hydroperiod collection to database and enable filtering by clouds in preparation (done! ‚úÖ)
- [x] **Important**: Create `lunch scripts` using `argparse` to run them from `crontab`
- [x] Make this a python package where reference image and PIAs are parameters of the class
